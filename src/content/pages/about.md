I've been a sailor all my life, about 40 years or so, but I do enjoy the winter and skiing a lot and can't live without it. I have tried one year and I was miserable. Now I've got xc roller skis so I can "ski" in the summer too.

So, I started aou as an Opti sailor when I was young. Started when I was 7 or 8 years old. I found the Opti as a good platform to start sailing and I was lucky to have a vibrant environment around my sailing club in the early years with some pretty good sailors to look up to and learn from. That's where I layed the foundation for my sailing career. From there it was the usual route and here is a short CV:

- **Optimist** in the '80s participating at the Worlds in '85 finishing in the latter part of the result list.
- **Europe** dingy late '80s early '90s finishing 8 at the Worlds in Brazil '91. Equipment was hard to get right at that time.
- **Laser** for the first Olympics in Savannah '96. Never made it to the Olympics but I finished 3rd at the worlds in '95 and 4th in '94. Ranked 2nd in the worlds for a few years.
- **Education**, Big boat stuff and some 49'er for a few years up to the turn of the millennia.
- **Day job** for a while
- **Coaching** for the Norwegian Sailing Assosiation for a few years
- **Melges 24** 3rd and 5th at the worlds
- **Stars** from 2006 and up to the Olympics in London 2012 where we finished 4th. With Petter MÃ¥rland Pedersen.
- **Volvo Ocean Race** 2008-09 with Ericsson 3 as helmsman

The last few years I have been doing **Stars** a bit and have been ranked as **#1** on the SSL global ranking for a while now. 

I will be the Captain of the Norwegian entry in the SSL Gold Cup and will be sailing some Stars too and other engagements as I can in different boats. If you need some help please don't hesitate to drop me a line through the form on the contact page. Cheers.
